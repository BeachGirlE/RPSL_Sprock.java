# Pseudocode :)
### - Check readme for what the game is
## Steps and braindump
### 1. Print out the name of the game
- Make sure the user knows what they are doing, and how to play
  - how to play:
    - They need to know what option beats what option and so forth
    - They should also know who they are going against 
### 2. Make a randomizer for the computer
- Have it randomized between rock, paper, scissor, lizard and spock for the computer to go against the user
- Have the option that the computer gets print out when the user picks their option
### 3. Allow the computer to go against a user
- Add in something that will make the computer wait until the user chooses their option, and types it out
### 4. Have the user pick an option to go against the computer
- If the option the user picked lost against the computer make it say "[option you picked loses against the computer]" or something like that
  - the else in what is listed below is the losing conditional.
- If the option the user picked wins against the compute make it say "[option you picked won against the computer]" or something like that
- If they tie, make it say "You have tied against the computer"
### 5. Rounds
- Make it so that it is best out of three round
  - if they tie, the round does not progress
  - if computer or user wins, make it say "[user] or [computer] won, they have gained a point. 1/3"
  - Once the best out of three round ends, ask the user if they want to play again
- Maybe allow the user to make the round max set? (this is optional)
